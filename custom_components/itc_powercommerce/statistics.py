"""Backfill historical readings as external statistics.

A normal sensor can only ever record the present, so the portal's ~14 months
of monthly readings are written straight into the recorder's statistics
tables via :func:`async_add_external_statistics`.

The row rules — alignment, monotonic ``sum``, the zero baseline — live in
:mod:`.series` so they are testable without Home Assistant. This module adds
what needs the recorder: reading back the stored baseline and writing.

``Decimal`` all the way in, ``float`` only on the last line before handing a
value to the recorder. The portal dates are bare ``DD.MM.YYYY``, so they are
anchored at midnight in the *portal's* timezone, never in Home Assistant's.
